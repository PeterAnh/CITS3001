# CITS3001

CITS3001 reinforces key concepts from CITS2200 Data Structures and Algorithms and extends them to the context of autonomous programs, or agents. We introduce ideas such as decision-making, goal-directed behaviour, heuristic search, action selection, performance (self-)evaluation, expected return, and learning. These concepts are explored in the context of artificial intelligence or 'intelligent agents'.
